# Ship landing

For PR-based ship tasks, the ready signal is `done [at=<epoch>]: PR <url>` after the worker opens a non-draft PR; a lane that deliberately holds a draft declares a wait instead, and `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` refuses to arm merge monitoring on a draft.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` with the URL copied from that ready signal - it records `pr=` and the forge's `pr_head=` when available in the task's meta and arms the watcher's merge poll.
`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh` owns the named-head gate on that ready signal: a ship `done:` whose named head exists only in the worker's disposable copy is not ready (`bin/fm-crew-state.sh` reports blocked, `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` refuses to register, and a secondmate does not publish that done upstream).
That blocked reading is the gate working, not a stuck worker, so steer the worker on the commit the refusal names rather than waiting.
A direct-PR worker pushes that commit to its PR branch, and a local-only worker commits it on its ship branch.
Tell the captain the PR's full `https://...` URL copied from the worker's ready line or the task's `pr=` metadata, and a concise outcome summary.
A captain instruction to merge is explicit authority; `yolo` is the only standing routine merge authority.
For any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself, keep it an ordinary single-link mode-`0700` file, print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, then bind its current bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh <id>` before the watcher may execute it.
Retire a custom check only through `bin/fm-check-unregister.sh <id>` (or `bin/fm-teardown.sh` for a spawned task); never hand-compose an `rm` with `$STATE`/`$ID`.

Tear down a ship task only after landing is confirmed.
A teardown refusal for uncommitted or unlanded work is a stop-and-investigate result, never an obstacle to bypass.
Never force teardown without explicit discard authority.
After successful teardown, record completion, retain only the configured recent Done history, and re-evaluate queued work whose blockers and time gates have cleared.

A secondmate is persistent and an empty queue is healthy.
Retire one only on an explicit captain or main-firstmate decision, after loading `secondmate-provisioning`; its home must contain no work under way, and forced discard still requires explicit captain authority.
